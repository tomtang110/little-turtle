'''
Generates a list L of random nonnegative integers at most equal to a given upper bound,
of a given length, all controlled by user input.

Outputs four lists:
- elements_to_keep, consisting of L's smallest element, L's third smallest element,
  L's fifth smallest element, ...
  Hint: use sorted(), list slices, and set()
- L_1, consisting of all members of L which are part of elements_to_keep, preserving
  the original order
- L_2, consisting of the leftmost occurrences of the members of L which are part of
  elements_to_keep, preserving the original order
- L_3, consisting of the LONGEST, and in case there are more than one candidate, the
  LEFTMOST LONGEST sequence of CONSECUTIVE members of L that reduced to a set,
  is a set of integers without gaps.
